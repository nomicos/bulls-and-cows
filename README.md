# Bulls and Cows

This is an amateur implementation of the classic code-breaker game
using the C++ programming language. The project is not supposed to
be anything serious. Instead, it serves a purpose of demonstrating
the powers of:

* [the C++ programming language](https://isocpp.org/),
* [the Git version control system](https://git-scm.com/),
* [GitHub, a Git repositories hosting](https://github.com/),
* [makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefiles.html)

and some other technologies and concepts to me (and maybe somebody
else, as the project is open source and the repository is public).
You are free to use any part of the project under [the MIT license]
(LICENSE.md).

As for the game, you can read more about it on Wikipedia:

Some day I want to write a (yet another) PC version of
[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), but for
that I'm going to need either a good graphics library for C++ or
another programming language. At this moment I'm learning the
Standard C++.

Enjoy the game!
